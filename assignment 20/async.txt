1). How does async/await help with performance and scalability?
answer=>Increase the performance and responsiveness of your application, particularly when you have long-running operations that do not require to block the execution. In this case, you can perform other work while waiting for the result from the long running task.

2). Is it possible to use async/await with promise chains? If yes,
how can this be achieved?

Answer=>Async/Await is a way to write asynchronous codes in Javascript. They implicitly use Promises. The primary goal of Async/Await is to make working with Promises easier.
		function test(){
 return new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
 resolve('successful');
    });
}

let a = test();
a.then(resolved => console.log(resolved));

async function main() {
 let a = await test();
 console.log(a);
}

function test(){
 return 'successful';
}
